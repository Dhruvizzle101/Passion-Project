/* 
This is a placeholder for stock-simulator.png

In a real implementation, this would be a screenshot or mockup image 
of a stock trading simulator interface designed for teens, showing:

- Virtual portfolio dashboard
- Stock search functionality
- Buy/sell interface with simple explanations
- Performance tracking charts
- Educational tooltips explaining key concepts

The image would use the same color scheme as the main site (blue, green accents)
and would showcase an approachable UI suitable for beginners.

Size: approximately 800x600px with subtle drop shadow and rounded corners
