/* 
This is a placeholder for portfolio-builder.png

In a real implementation, this would be a screenshot or mockup image 
of a portfolio building tool for teens, showing:

- Asset allocation pie chart
- Risk assessment slider
- Investment goal setting interface
- Diversification score
- Performance comparison against benchmarks
- Recommendations based on risk tolerance

The image would illustrate how teens can create balanced portfolios
aligned with their investment goals and risk tolerance.
