This is a placeholder for chart-reader.png

In a real implementation, this would be a screenshot or mockup image 
of an interactive chart analysis tool for teens, showing:

- Candlestick chart with clear labels
- Pattern recognition highlighting
- Indicator overlays (moving averages, MACD, RSI)
- Timeframe selection options
- Learning mode with explanations of chart patterns

The image would demonstrate how teens can learn to identify bullish and bearish
patterns in a user-friendly interface with clear visual cues.
